                    <p id="woodcarver"><span id="first-letter">K</span>hing, the master carver, 
                        made a bell stand of precious wood. When it was finished, 
                        all who saw it were astounded. They said it must be the 
                        work of spirits. The Prince of Lai said to the master carver: 
                        "What is your secret?" 
                        <br/>
                        Khing replied, "I am only a workman: 
                        I have no secret.  There is only this: When I began to think 
                        about the work you commanded I guarded my spirit, did not 
                        use it on trifles that were not to the point. I fasted in 
                        order to set my heart at rest. After three days fasting, 
                        I had forgotten praise or criticism. After seven days I had 
                        forgotten my body with all its limbs. 
                        <br/>
                        "By this time all 
                        thought of your Highness and of the court had faded away. 
                        All that might distract me from the work had vanished. 
                        I was collected in the single thought of the bell-stand." 
                        <br>
                        Then I went to the forest to see the trees in their own 
                        natural state. When the right tree appeared before my eyes, 
                        the bell stand also appeared in it, clearly, beyond doubt.
                        All I had to do was to put forth my hand and begin. 
                        <br>
                        If I had not met this particular tree there would have 
                        been no bell stand at all.” "What happened?” “My own collected 
                        thoughts encountered the hidden potential in the wood: from 
                        this live encounter came the work which you ascribe to the 
                        spirits.""</p>
