                    <p><span id="first-letter">J</span>esus continued: "There was a man 
                        who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, 'Father, 
                        give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property 
                        between them.
                        <br>
                        "Not long after that, the younger son got together 
                        all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered 
                        his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there 
                        was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be 
                        in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that 
                        country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to 
                        fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but 
                        no one gave him anything. 
                        <br>
                        "When he came to his senses, he said, 
                        'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here 
                        I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father 
                        and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against 
                        you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like 
                        one of your hired men.' So he got up and went to his father. 
                        <br>                     
                        "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and 
                        was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw 
                        his arms around him and kissed him. 
                        <br>
                        â€œThe son said to him, 
                        'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no 
                        longer worthy to be called your son.'"But the father said to 
                        his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. 
                        Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the 
                        fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. 
                        For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost 
                        and is found.' 
                        <br>
                        So they began to celebrate. "Meanwhile, the 
                        older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he 
                        heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants 
                        and asked him what was going on. 'Your brother has come,' 
                        he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf 
                        because he has him back safe and sound.' 
                        <br>
                        "The older brother 
                        became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out 
                        and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, 'Look! 
                        All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed 
                        your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I 
                        could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours 
                        who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, 
                        you kill the fattened calf for him!' 
                        <br>
                        "'My son,' the father said, 
                        'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we 
                        had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was 
                        dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found'""</p>
